str = I am trying to build logic.
Output 1:
I Am Trying To Build Logic

Input 2:
str = The classes are supposed to start early.

The Classes Are Supposed To Start Early.

Input 3:
str = We are going to look at 26 different test cases.
Output 3:
We Are Going To Look At 26 Different Test Cases.
